# AI Travel Agent - Project Context

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: TravelMind AI
**Course**: CS50 Final Project
**Timeline**: Before 20 September 2025
**Goal**: A user friendly way to plan vacations

## Background and context (First Prompt)
I need your help in planning a project for me. I am an 18 year old from South Africa currently studying data science at Stellenbosch University. I have just finished the CS50 online course and have started with CS50 AI.I am currently on holiday and would love to make money online. To finish CS50 I have to create a final project which I've decided I would like to see if I can also make some money with it. My idea is to create an AI travel agent that allows a user to plan their vacation and book it through my website. The travel agent must first find out what the user's preferences are and then should plan out a holiday for the user, but the user can edit the AI's suggestions to fit their preferences better. Additional features I'd like to add would be for it to map out each day and help plan the transport for the users as well (including walking and renting cars as well as flights), I would also like to add a feature that allows the user to book through my site using only the AI agent's suggestion (thus fully acting as a travel agency) and I would also like to add a feature whereby the user can add this all to their calendar as well as sharing a link to whoever else is invited on this vacation for their booking details and flight or train ticket details. I know this is a big project and I am a novice programmer with no prior experience in creating web apps (other than the course taught me). I've worked out and I have 30 hours to create an MVP for this project and I would like to hand in the MVP as my final project for CS50 and take on the rest of the project afterward. I would like you to scope out a plan to create this business and scope out what an MVP might look like. If you have any questions before we get started, please ask so that we can plan this project to the best of our abilities. Additionally, if you have any suggestions on how to tweak the idea, feel free to make them. I understand that this is a learning opportunity, but I would love to make some money off of it, so I would also like it if you suggest monetization strategies for after I hand it in as my final project (taking into account that I am a South African citizen). As you can see on the image, all the green steps are where User input is required, all the orange steps are where AI input is required.

## Project plan
AI Travel Agent Project Plan
Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing an AI-powered travel
agent web application. The project will be implemented in two phases:
MVP Phase: A 30-hour development sprint to create a minimum viable product for
submission as a CS50 final project
Business Development Phase: Post-MVP expansion to create a fully functional
travel planning and booking platform with monetization capabilities
The AI travel agent will help users plan vacations by collecting their preferences through
a conversational interface, recommending destinations, suggesting activities and
accommodations, creating customizable itineraries, and facilitating bookings through
external partners (MVP) or directly (future development).
Project Vision
Core Value Proposition
An AI-powered travel agent that simplifies vacation planning by: - Understanding user
preferences through natural conversation - Providing personalized destination
recommendations - Creating customizable day-by-day itineraries - Suggesting activities,
accommodations, and transportation options - Facilitating bookings and reservations -
Offering shareable travel plans and calendar integration
Target Audience
Global travelers with higher income
Users who have some idea of activities they want but limited destination
knowledge
People who value convenience and personalization in travel planning

Conclusion
The AI travel agent project represents an exciting opportunity to combine AI technology
with travel planning to create a valuable service for users while establishing a potentially
profitable business. The phased approach—starting with a focused MVP for CS50 and
expanding to a full-featured platform—provides a practical path forward that balances
academic requirements with business potential.
By leveraging existing AI and travel APIs, the project can achieve significant functionality
even within the 30-hour MVP constraint. The South African perspective offers unique
opportunities in the travel market, particularly for connecting global travelers with
African destinations.
This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap for both the immediate development
needs and the longer-term business vision, setting the foundation for a successful
project and potential business venture.
